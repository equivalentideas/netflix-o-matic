  <h1 style="margin-top:20px;">Humans are watching more <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> than ever. We'd like to help.</h1>
  <p>At <a href="http://goodformandspectacle.com">Good, Form & Spectacle</a> we're interested in what happens when you take away search boxes on websites. Turns out it can be pretty fun, especially when you have well-constructed classifications that lead you to movies you didn't know you wanted to watch.</p>
  <p>Here's the story of our Netflix Genre Explorer...</p>

  <h2>January 2, 2014</h2>
  <p>Madrigal publishes in The Atlantic. <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/how-netflix-reverse-engineered-hollywood/282679/"><em>How Netflix Reverse Engineered Hollywood</em></a> included a "Netflix genre generator" and lots of interesting stuff about how he pulled everything apart.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>"We've now spent several weeks understanding, analyzing, and reverse-engineering how Netflix's vocabulary and grammar work. We've broken down its most popular descriptions, and counted its most popular actors and directors. </p>
    <p>"To my (and Netflix's) knowledge, no one outside the company has ever assembled this data before.</p>
    <p>"What emerged from the work is this conclusion: Netflix has meticulously analyzed and tagged every movie and TV show imaginable. They possess a stockpile of data about Hollywood entertainment that is absolutely unprecedented. The genres that I scraped and that we caricature above are just the surface manifestation of this deeper database."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So, before we knew it, Madrigal's research had become a full-blown article. Darn! I was left feeling that this "caricature" in the article was just that, and not actually useful at all to people looking for something to watch. <em>Could we make something useful?</em> My interest is not dismemberment, but revelation and fun.</p>  
  <p>Since the article came out, we've each looked at this when we've had time. There's a server and search, a lot of poking at big spreadsheets, and getting together when we could. Designs started popping out mid-September, and here we are.</p>
  
  <p>We hope you enjoy it! <a href="/">Scramble</a>?</p>
